RealTimeChat is an application developed by myself in order to progress my knowledge of WebSocket servers, and learn the Go Proramming langauge
This is meant to mimic old chat forums, where users can enter anonymously with any username they choose, and create public or private rooms
for friends to join talk to each other, or meet new people.
